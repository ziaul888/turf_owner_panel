Includes multiple dashboards, authentication layouts, customizable theme presets, and more.

<img src="https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard/blob/main/media/dashboard.png?version=4" alt="Dashboard Screenshot">

The idea behind this dashboard aims to offer an alternative to typical admin templates. Most I came across, paid or free, felt cluttered, outdated, or too rigid in design.

Iâ€™ve taken design inspiration from various sources. Feel free to open an issue or reach out for credits.

> [!TIP]
> Iâ€™m also working on Nuxt.js, Astro, Svelte, and React (Vite + TanStack Router) versions of this dashboard. Theyâ€™ll be live soon.

## Features

- Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI
- Responsive and mobile-friendly design
- Customizable theme presets (light/dark modes with color schemes like Tangerine, Brutalist, and more)
- Multiple layout options (collapsible sidebar, content width variations)
- Authentication layouts and screens
- Dashboard screens for analytics, reports, and overview
- Prebuilt dashboard screens and reusable UI components  
- Includes 5 out of 15 planned screens
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with config-driven UI and multi-tenant support *(planned)*

> [!NOTE]
> The default version of the dashboard uses the **shadcn neutral** theme.  
> It also supports multiple color themes inspired by [Tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com), including:
>
> - Tangerine  
> - Neo Brutalism  
> - Soft Pop  
>
> You can add more presets by following the same structure as the existing ones.

> Looking for the **Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS v3** version?
> Check out the [`archive/next14-tailwindv3`](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard/tree/archive/next14-tailwindv3) branch.  
> It uses a different color theme and isnâ€™t actively maintained, but Iâ€™m trying to keep it updated with the latest changes and screens.

## Colocation File System Architecture

Pages, components, and logic are grouped by feature. Each route folder contains everything it needs. Shared UI, hooks, and config live at the top level, keeping the codebase modular and scalable as the app grows.
